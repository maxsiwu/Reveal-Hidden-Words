# Reveal-Hidden-Words

1. Create a layer in front of the words you want to reveal
2. Change the width of this layer onc lick
3. Only work on solid backgrounds, no gradient or moving particles
4. Small to work with, instead of complex code, this might get the job done faster
5. jQuery used
6. Note: this code is actually first revealing then hiding again, not just reveal
